These files are used in conjunction with the Frontend Web Development - Learn Bootstrap live class.

They consist of an HTML file called template-bootstrap.htm that has HTML markup for the basic elements of a website,
and bootstrap classes that add CSS style rules and JavaScript actions to the site. 
Instructions of how to use this file are at http://code.techandstartup/learn-bootstrap/ and further instruction is
given in the live class.

There are four additional folders. The source for the Bootstrap files is http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/.

css - holds the Bootstrap css files.<br>
js - holds the Bootstrap JavaScript files.<br>
fonts - holds the Bootstrap/glyphicons icon files.<br>
img - holds sample image files linked to in the template-bootstrap.html file.
