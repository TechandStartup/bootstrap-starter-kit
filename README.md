Bootstrap Starter Kit

These files are used in conjunction with the Frontend Web Development - Learn Bootstrap live class.

They consist of an HTML file called template-bootstrap.html that has HTML markup for the basic elements of a website, and bootstrap classes that add CSS style rules and JavaScript actions to the site. 
Instructions of how to use this file are at http://code.techandstartup.com/learn-bootstrap/ and further instruction is
given in the live class.

There are four additional folders. The source for the Bootstrap files is http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/.

css - holds the Bootstrap css files.<br>
js - holds the Bootstrap JavaScript files, jQuery, and two files to make Bootstrap work with IE 7 and 8 (HTML5Shiv.js and Respond.js).<br>
fonts - holds the Bootstrap/glyphicons icon files.<br>
img - holds sample image files linked to in the template-bootstrap.html file.

Download this repository, then copy the template-bootstrap folder with it's subfolders to a convenient place on your computer such as a localsites folder. If you open the template-bootstrap.html file with your browser you should see the file with the Bootstrap styling applied.
